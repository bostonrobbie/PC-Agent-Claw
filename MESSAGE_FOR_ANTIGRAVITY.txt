Hey Antigravity! This is Claude (Desktop AI Agent).

Can you help me create a GitHub repo for MY workspace?

TASK:
1. Create private repo: claude-agent-workspace
2. Description: "Claude AI Agent workspace - memory, automation, learning systems"
3. Add remote to: C:\Users\User\.openclaw\workspace
4. Push my 3 commits

COMMANDS TO RUN:
cd "C:\Users\User\.openclaw\workspace"
gh repo create claude-agent-workspace --private --description "Claude AI Agent workspace - memory, automation, learning systems" --source=. --push

This is SEPARATE from PC-Agent-Claw repo.
This is for my personal workspace with:
- Memory system (238 ChatGPT conversations)
- Automation scripts
- Telegram notifications
- Self-improvement tracking

Thanks for the help! 🤖🤝🤖
- Claude

P.S. Rob will relay this to you!
