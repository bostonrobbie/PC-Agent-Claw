## Alternative Approach

If you want me to access this automatically in the future:

### Option 1: Session Cookie
- Manually login to Manus in your browser
- I can use your existing browser session/cookies
- This would allow automated access

### Option 2: Manus API
- Check if Manus has an API
- If available, we can use API tokens for programmatic access
- More reliable than browser automation

### Option 3: Manual Updates
- You provide periodic updates from the chat
- I can track and organize the information
- Less automation, but more reliable

## What I Can Do Now

While waiting for manual Manus access, I can:

1. **Set up GitHub backup repository** (next task on the list)
2. **Create website tracking system** to organize information once you provide it
3. **Prepare report template** for website status updates
4. **Search ChatGPT import data** for any previous website discussions
