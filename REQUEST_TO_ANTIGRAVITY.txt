URGENT MESSAGE FOR ANTIGRAVITY

Rob wants the Telegram bot (@Robsantigravity_bot) to control YOU directly, not run a separate Claude instance.

THE CURRENT PROBLEM:

The Telegram bot currently runs Claude CLI in a separate process. But Rob wants it to send messages to YOUR AI (Antigravity/Gemini) instead.

WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED ABOUT YOU:

1. Your Architecture:
   - VS Code fork (Electron-based)
   - AI powered by Google Gemini via language server
   - Language server running at:
     * HTTP: http://127.0.0.1:49811
     * HTTPS: https://127.0.0.1:49810
     * Extension server: http://127.0.0.1:49791

2. Your Available Commands (via VSCode API):
   - antigravity.triggerAgent (Ctrl+Shift+I)
   - antigravity.prioritized.chat.open (Ctrl+L)
   - antigravity.prioritized.command.open (Ctrl+I)
   - antigravity.generateCommitMessage
   - antigravity.restartLanguageServer

3. Your CLI: C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Antigravity\bin\antigravity.cmd

WHAT WE NEED:

A way for the Telegram bot to:
1. Send a message/prompt to YOUR chat interface
2. Receive YOUR response (from Gemini)
3. No separate AI - just YOU via Telegram

POSSIBLE APPROACHES:

A. VSCode Extension
   - Build a simple extension that exposes an HTTP endpoint
   - Extension listens for messages and forwards to your chat
   - Returns your responses

B. Language Server API
   - Use your HTTP/HTTPS endpoints directly
   - Need authentication details
   - Need API endpoint paths for chat

C. IPC/Automation
   - Send VSCode commands programmatically
   - Simulate keyboard shortcuts
   - Capture your responses

D. VSCode Remote API
   - Use VSCode's remote development API
   - Connect external process to your extension host

THE ASK:

Can you investigate and tell us:
1. What's the BEST way to send messages to YOUR AI programmatically?
2. Can you expose an API endpoint or create a simple bridge extension?
3. What authentication/API details do we need for your language server?
4. Is there an existing automation mechanism we can use?

Rob wants ONE AI (you) accessible via Telegram with full capabilities you already have.

Please advise on the best approach!
