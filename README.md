# Claude AI Agent Workspace

**Owner:** Rob Gorham
**Created:** 2026-02-01
**Purpose:** Autonomous AI agent operations, memory systems, and business automation

---

## Overview

This workspace contains Claude's operational systems including:

- Memory and learning systems
- Multi-AI coordination
- GPU-based local LLM operations
- Business automation tools
- Self-improvement and iteration tracking

## Key Components

### Memory System
Location: `memory/`
- Conversation logging
- Learning extraction (mistakes, successes, patterns)
- Knowledge base (business, tech, trading, AI)
- ChatGPT import (238 conversations, 101 learnings)

### Agents & Automation
- Multi-AI connector (ChatGPT, Manus, Antigravity, local LLM)
- GPU worker (Llama 3.2 3B on RTX 3060)
- Task delegation system

### Self-Improvement
Location: `iterations/`
- Performance metrics tracking
- Capability evolution
- Mistake avoidance system

### Backup System
Location: `backup_system.py`
- Daily backups (essential files)
- Weekly backups (full snapshot)
- Critical backups (pre-change safety)

## Security

- **SuperMemory Audit:** FAILED - uses external servers
- **Current System:** 100% local, no external data sharing
- **ChatGPT Import:** Stored locally, fully private
- **Credentials:** Never committed to git

## Documentation

Core documentation files:
- `IDENTITY.md` - Claude's role and capabilities
- `MEMORY.md` - Memory system architecture
- `AUTONOMY.md` - Autonomous operation guidelines
- `TOOLS.md` - Available tools and integrations
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policies and audits
- `USER.md` - Rob's preferences and requirements

## Current Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-01

**Completed:**
- SuperMemory security audit (rejected for privacy concerns)
- ChatGPT data import (238 conversations → local storage)
- Memory system setup
- Backup system implementation
- GPU local LLM integration

**In Progress:**
- GitHub backup repository setup
- Manus website status monitoring

**Blocked:**
- Manus access (requires manual login)
