TEST MESSAGE FOR @Robsantigravity_bot

Send this to test if the bot now has full capabilities:

---

What directory are you currently working in? Can you list the files and folders here? Also, what tools do you have access to?

---

EXPECTED RESPONSE:

If the fix worked, the bot should respond with:

1. Current directory: C:\Users\User\Documents\AI

2. List of files/folders in that directory (like antigravity-telegram-bot, OpenClaw, etc.)

3. Full list of Claude Code tools available:
   - Read (read files)
   - Write (create files)
   - Bash (run terminal commands)
   - Edit (edit files)
   - Glob (find files)
   - Grep (search in files)
   - And more...

If you get this response, the bot is FULLY FIXED and has complete terminal access!

---

ADDITIONAL TEST:

You can also try:
- "Create a test file called hello.txt with the text 'Bot is working!'"
- "Show me the Python version"
- "What git branches exist here?"

These will confirm the bot can actually USE the tools, not just list them.
